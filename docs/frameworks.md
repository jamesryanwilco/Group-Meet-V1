# Proposed Frameworks & Technology Stack

This document outlines the proposed technology stack for the Group-to-Group Meetup App MVP. The choices prioritize rapid development, scalability, and a good developer experience.

## Mobile Application

*   **Framework:** **React Native (with Expo)**
    *   **Why:**
        *   **Cross-Platform:** Allows us to build for both iOS and Android from a single codebase, which is crucial for a startup to save time and resources.
        *   **Large Community:** A vast ecosystem of libraries, tools, and community support is available.
        *   **Expo Ecosystem:** Simplifies the development process with tools like Expo Go for live testing, over-the-air updates, and managed builds.
        *   **JavaScript/TypeScript:** Leverages a widely-known language, making it easier to find developers.

*   **Language:** **TypeScript**
    *   **Why:** Adds static typing to JavaScript, which helps catch errors early, improves code quality, and makes the codebase easier to maintain as it grows.

*   **Navigation:** **React Navigation**
    *   **Why:** The de-facto standard for routing and navigation in React Native apps, with a rich feature set and excellent community support.

*   **State Management:** **Zustand**
    *   **Why:** A small, fast, and scalable state management solution. It's simpler than Redux for an MVP and provides just enough structure without the boilerplate.

## Backend Services

*   **Backend as a Service (BaaS):** **Supabase**
    *   **Why:** An open-source Firebase alternative that provides a suite of powerful tools built on enterprise-grade technologies. It gives us the speed of a BaaS with more control.
    *   **Supabase Auth:** Handles user sign-up, login, and verification (email, phone, social logins) securely.
    *   **Supabase Database:** A dedicated PostgreSQL database for every project, offering the full power of relational SQL for storing user profiles, group information, and matches.
    *   **Supabase Realtime:** For building live features like the group chat functionality.
    *   **Supabase Edge Functions:** For any server-side logic we might need, written in TypeScript.

## Hosting & Deployment

*   **Backend Hosting:** **Vercel**
    *   **Why:** Vercel offers a seamless deployment experience for web projects and serverless functions (like Supabase Edge Functions), with excellent performance and a generous free tier.
*   **Mobile Development & Builds:**
    *   **Local Development:** **Expo Go** will be used for rapid development and testing on physical devices without needing to compile native code.
    *   **Development Builds:** For builds that require custom native libraries, `eas build --profile development` will be used to create installable development clients for iOS and Android.
*   **Deployment:**
    *   **App Stores:** Apple App Store & Google Play Store (managed via EAS Submit).
    *   **CI/CD:** GitHub Actions to automate testing and build processes.

## Verification

*   **Identity Verification:** A simple selfie + phone/email verification will be handled through **Supabase Auth** initially. For more robust verification in the future (Phase 2+), we could integrate a third-party service like **Stripe Identity**.
